# Project-GDP-Data-extraction-and-processing

Estimated time needed: **30** minutes

## Introduction

In this practice project, you will put the skills acquired through the course to use. You will extract data from a website using webscraping and reqeust APIs process it using Pandas and Numpy libraries.

## Project Scenario:

An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies of the world in descending order of their GDPs in Billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

The required data seems to be available on the URL mentioned below:

## Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

 - Use Webscraping to extract required information from a website.
 - Use Pandas to load and process the tabular data as a dataframe.
 - Use Numpy to manipulate the information contatined in the dataframe.
 - Load the updated dataframe to CSV file.

## Dislcaimer

If you are using a downloaded version of this notebook on your local machine, you may encounter a warning message as shown in the screenshot below.

This does not affect the execution of your codes in any way and can be simply ignored. 

# Setup
For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

*   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for managing the data.
*   [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for mathematical operations.

#Install required packages
!pip install pandas numpy 
!pip install lxml

### Importing Required Libraries

_We recommend you import all required libraries in one place (here):_

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# You can also use this section to suppress warnings generated by your code:
def warn(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
import warnings
warnings.warn = warn
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
